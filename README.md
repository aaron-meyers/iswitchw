## iswitchw 
### Fast keyboard driven window switching

---------------------------------------------------------

When iswitchw is triggered, the titles of all visible windows are shown in a
popup. Start typing to narrow possible matches -- hitting enter at any point
will activate the top match.

iswitchb strives to be as intuitive as possible. Tab through the matches.
Navigate up/down with the arrow keys. Hit Esc to cancel at any time.  Or
activate a window by clicking a title with the mouse instead.

User configurable options are listed at the top of the ahk file. Built using
AutoHotkey v1.1.11.01.

Original inspiration provided by the creators of the iswitchb package for the
Emacs editor.
